<p>The web application  (Flyers-Up) was founded. Mainly because it would be for users in a certain area to able to post their event or function of some sort. To their page and this page will be able to be viewed by any user who has this application. And is in the same city that the user chooses to post in the event/party whatever they so choose. The user does not have to post the event/party city wide there will also be an option so that it can just be postal zip code wide.	Then any user who has the application in that GPS range will be able to see the event flyer. Any user that views the flyer, the user who posted the flyer well be able see how many views he/she has gotten on the flyer. There will also be an option like voting if they will attend or not, liking it, reposting it. And these options allowing other users who are- able to view the user's profile an see your event are all at the user who posted the flyer discretion. This application will be useful to all- ages above 16. For- example teenage group, teenagers will find this application useful for multiple things such as parties, say some user wanted to have a football 7 on 7 tournament or basketball tournament and wanted a lot of people to come they could post the flyer postal zip code wide. I know we had a lot of events like tournaments in my city that I’m from. And also an option will be private mode were only people who follows the user could see this application. This application could also bring in great revenue because clubs and business could use this and purchase premium version well their flyer could be allowed state wide if there were having a club event that night or a business user was trying to host a job fair. And I haven’t even left out the older crowed say maybe some - user was hosting a bingo tournament this application would be useful. Well this is my idea that I have, please let me know if you think it would be to much work than I can bare.</p>
